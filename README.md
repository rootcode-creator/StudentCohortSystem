# StudentCohortSystem


**Student Chort System**

**I created a Student Cohort System, which will get user information from the Google account through Google API when the user login for the first time. Moreover, it will create a cohort (like google classroom) to enable instructors to easily perform different classroom functions like teaching, grading, and other classroom functions.**
