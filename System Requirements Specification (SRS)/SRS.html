        <h2 style="color: #6637C5;">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>“E-learning” system is a platform where teachers analyzes the students’ performances through taking a 
          quiz online. This platform enables the teachers to practically distinguish the class performances and the 
          difficulty of the quizzes through a histogram statistics. This system ensures the exams are taken fairly and 
          within the given time maintaining standard conditions for an exam.</p>

        <h4 id="sec1.2">1.2 Document Convention</h4>
        <p>The SRS document contains standard use of words with paragraphs containing headers, sub-headers and table 
          formation along with attached screenshots.</p>
        
        <h4 id="sec1.3">1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
        <p>The primary intended audience of this SRS document are the project team members and our course instructor. 
          This document is simply organized for any software developers or technology related people to understand it 
          easily.</p>

        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>
        <p>The platform enables the teachers and students to interact virtually through a website where they can login 
          using their personal Gmail account. Also, there is an app for this system where the students can give exam and 
          the teachers can report and view it as well. The goal for this system is to let any institution take online 
          examination if there is any pandemic or any natural occurances.Also,maintaing the standard procedures of taking
          an exam like scanning the face of a student, timer countdown, eye movement tracking and using Gmail accounts 
          which ensures fair examination policies and evading any unfair advantages of taking the examination by any 
          other means.Also,the android app support will allow the students and teachers to interact if they are unable 
          to use the website for any cause so they can directly interact the platform using their smartphones.</p>

        <p> 
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p>The idea of this system is inspired from the previous area-wise lockdown enforced all over Bangladesh as a 
          counter measure to the pandemic. The idea of this system is a combination of both google classroom and 
          google meet together but in a more advanced way with a lot more features and security. The idea of this 
          system is mostly designed for education purposes. This system tries to conduct the best online exams, as it 
          has many features for the teachers to conduct a fair exam. This system is mostly useful for institutions like 
          school or private classes or even home tutoring</p>

        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p>As this system is totally based on online teaching and learning, this system targets the education 
          management like any institution, private coaching or even home tutoring, where the teachers and the 
          students are the ones to interact with our systems’ website.</p>
          <p><u>Based on technical expertise</u>: </p>
        <p><table style="width:100%">
          <tr align="center">

                <li>Monitor how much time the student is taking to read per page.</li>
                <li>Teachers will have a cohort view where they can see the average time taken for the students 
                  to complete their exam and a histogram that shows performance of every students marks.</li>
                <li> Teachers will get notified if the student is not looking at the screen or not sitting properly 
                  during the exam using eye detection.</li>
                <li>An app is made for the teachers for their convenience to use it from anywhere.</li>

              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Student</td>
            <td>Can view the questions only and sit for the exam after completing all the verification process.</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Students will have to scan their ID and Face for verification for legitimacy</li>
                <li>Students can only view questions which will be divided into subpage design.</li>
                <li>Students can only use app for notifications about their exam and performance.</li>
                <li>They can only check the marks but cannot see which part of the answer is wrong unlike the teachers.</li>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        <p>Initially the app/website will ask if the user is a student or a teacher? And then they will sign in 
          with their respective emails.</p><br />

        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p><u>Android App</u>:</p>  
        <ol>
          <li>Device Hardware – 
          	<ul>
          	<li> “Android compatible” device.[1] </li>
          	</ul>
          
          <li> Operating System – Android 5.1 (Lolipop) or above. </li>
          <li> Software Component – Google Play Services, Sinch Android SDK. </li>
        </ol>
          <p><u>Website</u>: Any browser that runs html, css and javascript.</p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <p><ul>
        	<li>Students’ legitimacy is a concern, since anyone can sit for the quiz, though there is face and ID 
            verification.</li>
          	<li>Online exams might be unfair or unreliable, though their will be eye detection for the teachers to 
              monitor the students’.</li>
          	<li>Users bad webcam and speaker quality can hamper teachers monitoring during exam or hard for face 
              recognition.</li>
          	<li>The basic (free) version API/SDKs, database, hosting service that are used allow a threshold amount of 
              usage. It is important to note that their functionalities are essential for the system.</li>
          	<li>Since the Android OS is open source, it’s implementation differs from manufacturer to manufacturer. 
              Certain features of our app may not function smoothly due to restrictions put in the OS implementation</li>
          	<li>The App/website requires user permission for working with components like- fetching location, 
              microphone-speaker access, camera access etc.</li>
          	<li>The core features require continuous active internet connection.</li>
          	<li>The basic use of this system is only education purpose where the teachers and their students are the only 
              users</li>
        </ul></p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p>A demo video of the app and website usage will be available to the users. No
          documented manual is to be provided.</p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>Assumptions: <br>
        <ul>
    <li>Teachers and Students phones have working camera/webcam, microphone, speaker and/or headphone/earphone 
              connectivity.</li>
		<li>Each user needs their own google accounts.</li>
		<li>Each user needs to give access to all system requirements.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Dependencies:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Users need to have google play services installed on their android phones.</li>
        </ul>

 <h2 style="color:#6637C5">3. External Interface</h2>
 <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
 <p>The UI of the app is designed in such a way that any cohort/sub-cohort can interact with the application comfortably.
   When the cohort/sub-cohort launches the app for the first time, the landing page welcomes the cohort/sub-cohort with 
   "Sign Up (Get Started)" or "Sign In" option.</p><br>
   <p>The "Sign In" option will land the cohort/sub-cohort to the "Login" page where existing cohort/sub-cohort can use their credentials (e.g., email and password) to log in.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="Login.png" alt=""><br><br>

 <p>For the new cohort/sub-cohort, the "Sign Up" option will take them to a page where they have to enter their email and password to create their account.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="signup.png" alt=""> <br>

 <p>After the successful verification, the cohort/sub-cohort must have to set their profile by providing necessary information in the "Setup Profile" page (Example: picture for sub-cohort).</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="profilesetup.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
 <p>Completing a successful setup will redirect the cohort/sub-cohort to the internal system Page.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="internal_interface.png" alt=""><br><br>

 <p>Now cohort can assign sub-cohort to different sections.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="add_members.png" alt=""><br><br>
 <p>Cohort will upload pdf reading materials and which will be non downloadable for sub-cohort. </p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="file_upload.png" alt=""><br><br>

 <p>The system will divide the reading materials into different sub-part to make the reading easy for the eye of the sub-cohort, and reading materials will be non-downloadable.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="sub_part_divition.png" alt=""><br><br>
 <p> Before the sub-cohort start, the reading materials system will check for sub-cohorts so that system can track the reading statistic of reading materials means how much time the sub-cohort reads the materials, not wasting his/her time. To increase the productivity of the sub-cohort and there will be a time limit for every material.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="in_front_of_computer.png" alt=""> <br> <br>

 <p>After the end of every material, there will be a quiz to test the sub-cohort understanding. The sub-cohort will be able to see the marks of his quiz at the end of the quiz.</p>
 <img class="center" height = "450" width="300" src="test_options_timer.png" alt=""> <br>
 

 <p>On the app interface cohort will be able to see the individual time spent and total time spent on each section of materials by every sub-cohort. Moreover, the cohort will see the percentage of mistakes by sub-cohort in each section and the total percentage of mistakes made by sub-cohorts.</p>

 <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
 <p>The device that will run the application requires WIFI to read the materials and take the quiz. The device also needs the camera for the sub-cohort to detect the time the sub-cohort reads the materials.</p>

 <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
 <p>The minimum android operating system version required to run the application is "Lolipop5.1 (API level 22)".  The application will work properly on any device with the latest (from android 5.1 to 12) android operating system.</p>
 <p>The third-party software components that are going to be used are,
 <ul>
   <li>Migration scripts: A scripts have to run on the database to add the necessary data to run a cohort. This works well for this types of cohorts (static cohorts).</li>
   <li>Pdf splitter api (PDF.co) </li>
   <li>Ageitgey/face_recognition (GitHub Repository) </li>
   <li>Voice to text Recognition API (Google ML kit) </li>
   <li>Java based Android App</li>
   <li>Relational database (user registration)</li>
 </ul> 
 </p>

 <h4 "id="sec3.4">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h4>
 <p>Ageitgey/face_recognition is used to detect the face of sub-cohort using internet connections. Voice-to-text Recognition API and pdf splitter API is used for different Purpose.</p>

<h2 style="color:#6637C5;">5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <h4 id="sec5.1">5.1 Performance Requirements</h4>
        <p>For this platform, there is no performance requirements for the website application as it can run in any 
          browsers that can run html, css and JavaScript. The app version can run in any android compatible device with 
          the 5.1 Lolipop version and above. The real time system is designed such a way that there is no delay in time 
          and interaction between the users and the platform. The UI is precise and gives the users a smooth user 
          experience.</p>
        
        <h4 id="sec5.2">5.2 Safety Requirements</h4>
        <p>There are no safety requirements in this system as this is an E-Learning platform so the system is capable 
          enough to ensure a better user-friendly experience.</p>

        <h4 id="sec5.3">5.3 Security Requirements</h4>
        <p>The users must have to identify themselves while logging in as the system has face detection so any other 
          person impersonating will be detected.Also, they have to login using their personal Gmail accounts to sign in 
          and have to verify their account from their Gmail inbox. For students, the system is designed to eye movements 
          so they have to place the camera in the middle and their face should be eye level in the center of the screen 
          while attending the exam. If they look away from the screen or looking somewhere for a long time will report 
          back to the teachers.</p>

        <h4 id="sec5.4">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h4>
        <p>It is user friendly and have no maintenance problem whatsoever.</p>

        <h4 id="sec5.5">5.5 Business Rules</h4>
        <p>For the website version,</p>
        <p>Students can login using their Gmail account, read the material and attend the exam within a given time.
          Teachers can observe, analyze,summarize each student activities and also their results and report back.</p>
        <p>For app version,</p>
        <p>Students can login and attend the quiz and get notifications of starting and ending time.Teachers can only 
          report and navigate it.This system is free for both website and android version which doesn’t require any money 
          for purchasing the service.</p>




        <br><br><br>

        <h2 style="color:#6637C5;" id="section6">6. Other Requirements</h2>
        <p>One extra requirement of this project is to be inline with the latest technology trends and 
          make sure it is a software worthy of the next era. We have taken global research and advisory firm – 
          GreyCampus website’s predictions as guideline to achieve this:-</p>

        <p>According to GreyCampus the leading technologies in the software industries for this era are- AI, ML, 
          Cybersecurity, VR, AR, block-chain, intelligent search features. Their most recent prediction consists 
          of 10 technology trends for the ear 2022 which include- multi- experience, AI security etc. 
          The “E-learning System and Student Cohoet” system somewhat adheres to a few of these predictions 
          in its features. Such as-</p>
        
        <ol>
        	<li><u>Multi-experience</u>:Using these technology, this platform lets the teacher to monitor their 
            student’s performance and the teacher will know if the student is cheating or not. The system makes 
            easier for the teacher to catch the student who is cheating.</li><br>
        	
        	<li><u>AI</u>:  The system uses google play services.</li><br>
